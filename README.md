# Building

First install deps with `yarn install`. To build,

```bash
yarn build
```

# Testing

Write test cases in `tests/cases`. Running,

```bash
yarn test
```

Will then compare generated baselines to those in `tests/baselines/reference`. Any which fail will go into the `tests/baselines/local` folder, where you can inspect/diff them. To accept new baselines, run,

```bash
yarn baseline-accept
```
